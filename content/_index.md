## Why FIR Risk?

**Generic AI hallucinates.** It scrapes the internet and guesses. When the stakes are regulatory fines, fraud losses, or breach liability—guessing isn't good enough.

**FIR Risk is built on verified intelligence:** MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CISA KEV, ISO frameworks, and years of proprietary fraud prevention research.

Our AI doesn't guess—it cites.

> "Trained on frameworks, not forums."
