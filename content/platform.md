## The Knowledge Base

The foundation of everything we build. Not a generic language model—a curated intelligence system.

**What's Inside:**
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures
- **CISA KEV** — Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog
- **MITRE CAPEC** — Common Attack Pattern Enumeration
- **MITRE CWE** — Common Weakness Enumeration
- **NIST / ISO Frameworks** — Regulatory and compliance standards
- **Proprietary Intelligence** — Years of fraud prevention research

**14,000+ indexed threat patterns, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques.**

The AI doesn't guess—it cites verified sources.

**Capabilities:**
- Case history and timeline tracking
- Entity linking and pattern detection
- AI-drafted investigation reports

## Risk Evaluation Workspace

Structured risk assessment tied to real threat intelligence.

**Capabilities:**

## Your Data Stays Yours

We use a split-brain architecture:

- **Public Brain** — Our knowledge base (frameworks, regulations, threat intel) lives in our secure cloud
- **Private Memory** — Your data stays in your environment

**The Guarantee:** Our AI reads your data to solve problems. It never trains on it. Your secrets don't become our product.
