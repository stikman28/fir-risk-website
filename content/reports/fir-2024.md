## 4 Key Takeaways

### Takeaway #1: Analyze Your Data
Financial motives drive fraudulent activity. Analyze incoming traffic and transactional data to find suspicious patterns. Look and you will find—the more you look, the more you will find.

### Takeaway #2: Manage User Accounts
Fraudsters create fake accounts, crack passwords, and buy stolen credentials. Analyze account usage, disable dormant users, identify abusive accounts, and remove unused service accounts.

### Takeaway #3: Enforce Access Controls
Help users maintain secure accounts through best practices—activity notifications, strong passwords, MFA, and authentication cookies bound to user fingerprints.

### Takeaway #4: Secure Web Applications
Web application attacks are the top risk vector. Identify and remediate vulnerabilities, practice secure coding, and build security into software designs.
