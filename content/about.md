### The FIR Risk Philosophy

> Accounting taught me to follow the numbers. Audit taught me to question everything. Technology gave me the tools. Risk management showed me where it all connects.

FIR Risk Advisory was founded on the belief that AI can transform how organizations handle cyber threats, fraud, and compliance—but only when that AI is grounded in verified frameworks and real expertise.

We don't deploy generic chatbots. We build intelligence systems trained on MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CISA KEV, and decades of hands-on fraud prevention experience.
