## The INTEL

Red Canary recorded an **850% increase in identity threat detections** in 2025, making identity attacks their #1 threat category at 53% of total detection volume — up from 20% in 2024.

IBM X-Force independently confirms the same pattern: credential theft remained "at the center of many prominent campaigns," with over **300,000 ChatGPT credentials** discovered for sale on dark web markets. A category of credential that didn't exist two years ago.

This isn't two reports saying the same thing. It's two fundamentally different data sources — incident response engagements and endpoint telemetry across 4.5 million protected assets — arriving at the same conclusion independently. Cloud account compromises dominate Red Canary's threat landscape. Browsers have emerged as the primary staging ground for credential theft. The attack doesn't start with malware. It starts with a valid login.

## Why It Matters

This is the sixth consecutive 2026 annual threat report to confirm identity as the dominant attack vector. Unit 42: 90% of incidents involved identity compromise. Cloudflare: 63% of human logins use compromised credentials. CrowdStrike: 35% of cloud intrusions via valid accounts. Picus: credential theft double ransomware encryption. Mandiant: voice phishing at 11% because attackers call to get credentials.

Six reports. Six methodologies. One verdict. And the 850% detection surge signals the volume is still accelerating — every new SaaS platform, AI tool, and cloud service creates another credential to harvest. The identity attack surface isn't growing linearly with cloud adoption. It's growing exponentially.

## What To Do

**Architect systems that assume identity compromise, not just prevent it.** Prevention alone has failed at scale — the 850% surge proves that. Implement continuous identity monitoring with behavioral baselines that detect anomalous access patterns post-authentication. Reduce credential blast radius through aggressive privilege minimization — every credential should access the minimum needed, not the maximum available. Deploy identity "circuit breakers" that automatically limit account scope when behavior deviates from baseline. The question isn't whether credentials will be compromised. It's how much damage a compromised credential can do.

## MITRE ATT&CK

- **T1078 — Valid Accounts:** Dominant technique across both reports — 850% detection increase, cloud accounts as #1 technique in Red Canary data
- **T1586 — Compromise Accounts:** Infostealer ecosystem feeding credential markets at industrial scale (300K+ AI platform credentials)
- **T1528 — Steal Application Access Token:** Browser-based token theft enabling cloud account compromise without password
