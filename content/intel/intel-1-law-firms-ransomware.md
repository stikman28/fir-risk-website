## The INTEL

Law firms paid ransoms at a **41% rate in 2025**—about 14% more often than the cross-sector average of 36%.

Ransomware groups have noticed. According to GuidePoint's 2026 Ransomware Report:

- **217 law firm breaches** last year (12% of all ransomware incidents)
- **$1.2M average ransom demand**—up 60% from 2024
- **98% involved double extortion** (encryption + data leak threats)

The math is simple: law firms hold sensitive data, face extreme reputation pressure, and pay more often than anyone else. That makes them ideal targets.

## Why It Matters

Law firms aren't just targets—they're **gateways**. Compromising one firm exposes M&A details, litigation strategy, and client PII across dozens of corporate clients.

Attackers are now using LLMs to analyze stolen legal documents and prioritize high-value matters. Active M&A deals and pending litigation get flagged for maximum extortion pressure.

If you're a law firm—or rely on outside counsel for sensitive matters—your risk profile just changed.

## What To Do

- **Segment client data** — Zero-trust architecture between client matters
- **Audit your vendors** — Case management platforms (Clio, LexisNexis) are attack vectors
- **Immutable backups** — LockBit is specifically targeting offsite/cloud backups (MITRE T1489)
- **Legal-themed phishing simulations** — Fake court filings and client requests are the entry point

## MITRE ATT&CK

| Technique | Name | Relevance |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| T1566 | Phishing | Fake court documents, client requests, invoice macros |
| T1078 | Valid Accounts | Session hijacking, MFA fatigue attacks |
| T1489 | Service Stop | Backup destruction before encryption |
| T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact | 98% of attacks include encryption |
