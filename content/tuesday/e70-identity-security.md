## Weekly Risk Intelligence Brief

**Source:** [SailPoint — The Horizons of Identity Security 2025](https://www.sailpoint.com/identity-library/horizons-of-identity-security)

### The 30-Second Brief

SailPoint surveyed 375 IAM decision-makers and the headline is sobering: 63% of enterprises remain in the lowest two maturity horizons — highly manual processes, limited automation, and fragmented visibility. Meanwhile, AI agents are becoming the fastest-growing identity type, and less than 40% of organizations govern them.

Identity isn't just an access control mechanism anymore. It's a detection and response layer. And most organizations aren't ready.

## The Maturity Reality Check

### North America Leads — But Not By Much

**Maturity Distribution (North America):**
- Horizon 1–2 (low maturity): 54%
- Horizon 3 (digitalized, beginning automation): 32%
- Horizon 4+ (advanced, AI-driven): 14%

North American organizations lead globally due to regulatory pressure and higher security investment. But here's the uncomfortable detail: **4% of organizations actually regressed** in 2025 as capability thresholds rose — especially around AI agent governance.

> **INTEL [TREND]:** Over half of North American enterprises are still running identity programs with manual processes and fragmented visibility. If your organization is in Horizon 1–2, you're in the majority — but that's not a safe place to be. Benchmark your maturity and build a roadmap.

## The Non-Human Identity Problem

This is the section that should keep CISOs up at night.

- Less than **40% of organizations** currently govern AI agent identities
- One-third of organizations expect **30%+ growth** in non-human identities over 3–5 years
- **OWASP formally recognized** non-human identities as a top 2025 cyber risk
- Third-party identities (vendors, contractors, external workforce) remain inconsistently governed

Machine identities — service principals, API keys, AI agents, bots — are multiplying faster than human identities. And most organizations have no inventory, no lifecycle management, and no governance framework for them.

> **INTEL [VULNERABILITY]:** Non-human identities are the fastest-growing and least-governed identity type in most enterprises. OWASP's recognition of NHI as a top 2025 risk validates what the data shows — govern them now before growth makes it unmanageable.

---

## AI as an Identity Force Multiplier

The maturity gap creates a compounding advantage for organizations that invest:

- Mature organizations (Horizon 3+) deploy agentic AI for identity operations at **2x the rate** of others
- These firms are **2.8x more likely** to achieve cost savings from IAM
- **70% more likely** to see risk reduction from IAM investments
- Advanced organizations use identity signals in ITDR (Identity Threat Detection & Response) at **4x higher adoption rates**

> **INTEL [GLOBAL RECOMMENDATION]:** Identity-integrated threat detection reduces containment time and prevents lateral movement. If your SIEM/SOAR doesn't ingest identity signals today, it's missing the highest-value telemetry available.

---

## The Data Quality Problem

Even advanced organizations are struggling here: **44% of advanced orgs still report poor data quality** in their identity systems. And the downstream effects are severe:

- 48% of IAM deployments exceed budget
- 60% miss timelines
- Application onboarding remains the bottleneck

Automation is the tipping point — but automation built on bad data just scales mistakes faster.

> **INTEL [SECTOR ALERT]:** Data hygiene is the primary barrier to identity automation. Before investing in AI-driven identity tools, audit your data quality. Organizations optimizing identity data workflows are 90% more likely to see productivity gains.

---

## The ROI Case

IAM delivers the **highest perceived ROI** among security domains — outranking endpoint, data, cloud, and application security.

- Organizations optimizing identity data workflows are **90% more likely** to see productivity gains
- Mature programs achieve **10x+ ROI** when accounting for cost reduction, productivity, and reduced compliance penalties
- Identity-integrated threat detection reduces containment time and prevents lateral movement

This is your board-level justification. Identity isn't a cost center — it's the highest-returning security investment available.

---

## What CISOs Should Do Now

1. **Benchmark maturity levels** against SailPoint's Horizons framework to prioritize investments
2. **Govern non-human identities immediately** — inventory machine identities, AI agents, and service accounts before growth accelerates
3. **Normalize identity data** to unlock automation capabilities — bad data blocks every downstream initiative
4. **Integrate identity signals** into SecOps and SIEM/SOAR platforms for real-time threat detection
5. **Justify funding** using ROI and productivity benchmarks — this is the easiest security investment to defend at the board level

---

## The Bottom Line

"Identity has moved from an access gate to a security nerve center. CISOs that get ahead on identity visibility, AI governance, and automation will reduce risk, boost resilience, and unlock enterprise agility."

That's not aspiration. That's the data talking.
