## Weekly Risk Intelligence Brief

**Source:** [Trend Micro — 2025 Cyber Risk Report](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/threat-landscape/trend-2025-cyber-risk-report) (February–December 2024 data)

### The 30-Second Brief

Trend Micro's 2025 Cyber Risk Report quantifies what many organizations feel but can't measure: the gap between knowing your risks and actually fixing them. The average Cyber Risk Index sits at 38.4 out of 100 (medium risk). Over 1 billion accounts lack MFA or password expiration. All ten of the riskiest CVEs in 2024 were patchable — yet remained widely unpatched.

The data tells a clear story: most organizations know what to fix. The problem is speed of execution.

## The Risk Landscape

### Cyber Risk Index: 38.4 (Medium)

Trend Micro's CRI scores organizations on a 0–100 scale. The global average of 38.4 places most organizations in medium risk territory. But averages hide the outliers:

- **High-risk industries:** Education, Construction, Agriculture, Insurance
- **Most improved region:** Europe — driven by regulatory compliance pressure
- **Takeaway:** Regulation works. Industries without compliance mandates are falling behind.

> **INTEL [TREND]:** Trend Micro's Cyber Risk Index averages 38.4 (medium risk) globally, but high-risk industries — education, construction, agriculture, insurance — cluster significantly higher. Europe's improvement confirms that regulatory pressure drives measurable risk reduction. Industries without compliance mandates should benchmark against CRI data proactively.

---

### A Billion Accounts Without MFA

Over **1 billion accounts** lack MFA or password expiration protocols. 10+ security settings are regularly left unoptimized across endpoints. These aren't sophisticated attack surfaces — they're open doors.

> **INTEL [VULNERABILITY]:** Over 1 billion accounts lack MFA or password expiration controls. This isn't a technology gap — it's a governance gap. Identity hygiene at this scale represents the single largest addressable risk surface in most organizations. Automate stale account retirement and enforce MFA universally.

---

### Patch Times Tell the Story

Mean time to patch critical vulnerabilities by region:

| Region | Mean Time to Patch |
|--------|-------------------|
| Europe | 23.5 days |
| Americas | 29.2 days |
| AMEA | 32.9 days |
| Large orgs (>10K employees) | 41.3 days |

All ten of the riskiest CVEs in 2024 were patchable — yet remained widely unpatched. Larger organizations patch slower, not faster.

> **INTEL [SECTOR ALERT]:** Large enterprises (>10K employees) take 41.3 days on average to patch critical vulnerabilities — nearly double Europe's 23.5-day average. Every riskiest CVE of 2024 had patches available. This is a governance and process problem, not a technical one. Automate patching workflows and escalate unpatched critical CVEs to leadership.

---

### Email Threats Surging

**57 million high-risk emails blocked** — a 27% year-over-year increase. Email remains the #1 delivery mechanism for initial access, and volume is accelerating.

> **INTEL [ATTACK TECHNIQUE]:** High-risk email volume increased 27% YoY to 57 million blocked. AI is making phishing more convincing and harder to detect. Email security must evolve beyond signature-based filtering to behavioral analysis and real-time link detonation.

---

## Top 5 Enterprise Risks for 2025

1. **Risky cloud application access** — most frequently detected risk event
2. **Stale and weak account credentials** — the identity hygiene crisis
3. **Email-based threats** — primary surge area at +27%
4. **Endpoint misconfiguration** — 10+ settings regularly unoptimized
5. **Cloud infrastructure misconfigurations** — AWS, Azure, GCP policy drift

---

## Ransomware: Still Industrialized

Active groups in 2024: **LockBit, RansomHub, Black Basta**

Primary targets: Retail, Technology, Industrial, Transportation

The intrusion pattern is consistent: endpoint compromise through unpatched vulnerabilities, then lateral movement through identity weaknesses. The same hygiene gaps that appear in the CRI data are the same ones ransomware operators exploit.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL RECOMMENDATION]:** LockBit, RansomHub, and Black Basta continue to dominate ransomware activity. Their playbook is consistent: exploit unpatched endpoints, move laterally through weak identity controls. Closing the hygiene gaps in patching and identity governance directly reduces ransomware exposure.

---

## What Leaders Should Do Now

1. **Operationalize Cyber Risk Index as a board metric** — CRI gives executives a single number to track. Report it quarterly alongside financial risk metrics.

2. **Automate patching workflows** — 41.3-day patch times for large organizations are unacceptable. Automate critical CVE patching with SLA escalation.

3. **Enforce universal MFA** — 1 billion accounts without MFA is a governance failure. Automate stale account retirement and mandate MFA for all active accounts.

4. **Invest in AI-powered SOC tools** — Analyst fatigue is real. AI-driven triage and automated response playbooks reduce mean time to respond.

5. **Extend identity governance to inactive accounts** — Stale credentials are the #2 enterprise risk. Automate discovery and deprovisioning.

6. **Establish cyber hygiene as a cultural priority** — The top 5 risks are all addressable with basic hygiene. Make it a leadership accountability metric, not just an IT metric.

---

## The Bottom Line

Cybersecurity is no longer about stopping breaches. It's about staying ahead. Trend Micro's data shows most organizations know their risks — the gap is execution speed. A billion accounts without MFA. 41-day patch cycles. 57 million high-risk emails. The risks are quantified. The patches exist. The question is whether leadership will treat cybersecurity as a business resilience imperative or continue managing it as a technical function.
