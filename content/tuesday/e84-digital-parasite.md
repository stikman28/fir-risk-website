## Bottom Line

Adversaries have stopped trying to destroy your environment. They're moving in.

Picus Labs analyzed 1.1 million malicious files and 15.5 million adversarial actions across 2025. The data reveals a strategic pivot: **80% of the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques are now dedicated to evasion and persistence** — not disruption. Ransomware encryption declined 38% in one year. Credential theft is now twice as prevalent as data encryption. The adversary's primary success metric is no longer impact — it's dwell time.

Picus calls this the **"Digital Parasite"** — an adversary that inhabits the host, feeds on its identity systems, weaponizes its own infrastructure, and remains undetected for months. This is our fourth consecutive deep dive into a 2026 annual threat report, following [Unit 42 (E81)](/tuesday/e81-unit42-incident-response-debrief/), [Cloudflare (E82)](/tuesday/e82-cloudflare-threat-landscape/), and [CrowdStrike (E83)](/tuesday/e83-crowdstrike-global-threat-report/). The first three showed us the speed, the infrastructure, and the scale. Picus shows us the technique — exactly how adversaries are hiding inside your environment, and why your defenses may not be seeing them.

## Key Judgments

**1. The risk profile has inverted.** The primary threat is no longer business interruption from ransomware. It's undetected long-term access. Ransomware encryption dropped 38% while stealth techniques dominate 8 of the top 10 positions. Organizations optimized for ransomware response are fighting yesterday's war. *High confidence.*

**2. Your security tools may be compromised without alerting.** Adversaries now disable defenses as a standard first step, and self-aware malware refuses to execute when being analyzed. A green dashboard may indicate successful evasion, not the absence of threats. *High confidence.*

**3. Identity theft has become the primary objective, not a preliminary step.** Credential theft at 23% prevalence is now double ransomware encryption at 13%. Malware like SantaStealer bypasses browser encryption by calling legitimate APIs — no exploit required. *High confidence — consistent across all four 2026 threat reports.*

**4. Cloud APIs are the new command-and-control infrastructure.** The SesameOp backdoor routes C2 through OpenAI's Assistants API. Storm-0501 queries AWS Secrets Manager directly. Traditional firewall rules and blocklists are ineffective against C2 channels that use your own trusted services. *High confidence — confirmed across three 2026 reports.*

**5. The attack surface now extends below the operating system.** North Korean operatives deployed IP-KVM hardware for BIOS-level access — invisible to every software-based security control. Software-only visibility is no longer sufficient. *Moderate confidence — limited to DPRK operations, but technique is replicable.*

## Three Critical Shifts

The data reveals three fundamental changes in adversary behavior that explain why traditional defenses are failing:

**From Disruption to Infiltration.** Adversaries have realized that staying hidden is more valuable than causing immediate chaos. They're building long-term access to organizational infrastructure, identity systems, and data — becoming digital parasites that feed off their host while remaining undetected. The dominance of Process Injection (T1055) at #1 for three consecutive years signals that **blending in is now more critical to attackers than breaking in.**

**From Hunting Files to Weaponizing Trust.** The rise of Application Layer Protocol (T1071) and abuse of trusted services like OpenAI and AWS shows adversaries hiding in the spaces organizations can't afford to restrict. Security teams face an impossible choice: block OpenAI and cripple AI development, or allow it and accept the C2 risk. Adversaries have systematically mapped these blind spots — trust relationships you can't break, hardware layers you don't monitor, encrypted traffic you can't inspect.

**From Predator to Digital Landlord.** The technique rankings reveal adversaries have adopted a landlord mentality — establish long-term presence through process injection (#1), collect ongoing rent through credential access (#3), maintain the property through defense impairment (#8), and use legitimate channels to avoid suspicion (#5). **BRICKSTORM** demonstrated this model in practice — maintaining year-long persistence campaigns against IT and SaaS organizations, concealing C2 within encrypted web sessions while continuously extracting value.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [FINDING]:** The old risk was business interruption — ransomware locks your systems, operations stop, you pay to recover. The new risk is the adversary who's been in your environment for months, mapping your identity systems, understanding your data flows, and positioning for maximum extraction — all while your security tools report everything is clean. Security programs must shift from "hunting files" to "hunting behavior."

## Evidence

### The Stealth Shift: 80% Evasion, 38% Ransomware Decline

When you analyze the ten most common attack techniques observed across 1.1 million malicious files, **eight of them are designed to hide.** Not to steal. Not to encrypt. Not to destroy. To remain invisible inside your environment for as long as possible.

The #1 technique — for the third year running — is injecting malicious code into trusted applications. Your legitimate software becomes the weapon. The attacker walks in wearing your uniform.

Three techniques entered the top 10 for the first time this year: **sandbox evasion** (malware that detects when it's being analyzed and refuses to execute), **masquerading** (disguising malicious files as legitimate system processes), and **remote access tool abuse** (weaponizing AnyDesk, VS Code Tunnels, and hardware KVMs for persistent access).

Meanwhile, ransomware encryption **dropped 38% in one year** — falling from a dominant position to the bottom of the list. Ransomware hasn't disappeared. But the economics have shifted. Long-term access and silent data extraction are now more profitable than locking systems and demanding payment.

Mandiant's M-Trends 2025 data tells a complementary story — both Picus and Mandiant show ransomware declining and credential-focused techniques rising. Where they diverge is instructive: Picus leads with stealth techniques, Mandiant leads with speed techniques. This suggests **adversary specialization** — some groups optimize for invisibility, others for velocity. Both approaches are succeeding against traditional defenses.

*(Full technique rankings with MITRE ATT&CK IDs and specific malware attributions in the [Technical Reference](#mitre-attck-reference) below.)*

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [TREND]:** The 2026 technique rankings confirm a strategic pivot from disruption to inhabitation. Ransomware encryption declined 38% while evasion and masquerading techniques surged into the Top 10 for the first time. 80% of the top techniques are now stealth-focused. The adversary's primary success metric is dwell time, not impact.

### Self-Aware Malware: The Trigonometry Test

**LummaC2** calculates the Euclidean distance and angles of mouse cursor paths using trigonometry. A human moves a mouse in curves — small accelerations, natural arcs. An automated sandbox moves in straight lines. LummaC2 measures the difference. If the geometry says "machine," the malware plays dead. It won't detonate, won't connect to C2, won't exhibit any malicious behavior.

Your sandbox passes the file as clean. Your SOC closes the ticket. **The file that executed and did nothing isn't safe. It's waiting.**

Sandbox evasion had the year's most explosive growth — surging into the top 5 for the first time. Modern malware has developed survival instincts. It studies its environment before acting and only activates in production, on real machines, with real users. Adversaries aren't just evading current defenses — they're **anticipating future ones**, studying how defenders work and engineering around it.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [TECHNIQUE]:** Self-aware malware has surged into the top 5, with LummaC2 using trigonometric analysis of mouse movements to distinguish human users from automated sandboxes. If the threat detects it is being watched, it plays dead. Automated analysis verdicts can no longer be trusted at face value.

---

### The OpenAI C2 Channel

The **SesameOp backdoor** routes all command-and-control traffic through **OpenAI's Assistants API.** Every instruction from the attacker looks like a legitimate AI development request. Every exfiltrated payload looks like an API response. Your firewall sees traffic to api.openai.com and passes it. Your DLP sees JSON formatted like AI prompts and ignores it.

**The malicious traffic is indistinguishable from your AI development workflow because it IS your AI development workflow** — just with a different operator.

Similarly, **Storm-0501** queries **AWS Secrets Manager** directly using stolen cloud credentials — extracting API keys, database passwords, and service tokens without touching an endpoint. No file dropped. No process injected. Just legitimate API calls to a legitimate service. **Phantom Taurus** went further — bypassing email espionage entirely to target databases and web servers directly using NET-STAR malware. They've cut out the middleman. Instead of stealing emails about data, they go straight to the data.

E82 covered Cloudflare's "Living off XaaS" framework. E83 documented CrowdStrike's 266% increase in cloud intrusions. Picus quantifies the trend: **nearly 1 in 5 malware samples now uses legitimate cloud services for command-and-control**, and the channels of choice are the services you trust most.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [THREAT ALERT]:** SesameOp routes C2 through OpenAI APIs, Storm-0501 steals secrets directly from AWS, and Phantom Taurus targets databases directly — making malicious traffic indistinguishable from legitimate business operations. The perimeter has moved from the firewall to the identity provider.

### The Browser Password Heist

**SantaStealer** doesn't crack Chrome's AppBound encryption. It doesn't exploit a vulnerability. It calls Chrome's own internal APIs — the same ones the browser uses — to request decrypted passwords. **It asks the browser nicely, and the browser hands them over.**

Every password your employees have saved in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox — email, SaaS, VPN, banking — is accessible to malware that knows the right API call. No brute force. No cryptographic attack. Just a polite request through the front door.

Credential theft from browsers is now at 23% prevalence — **double the rate of ransomware encryption.** Meanwhile, the old noisy approach of dumping credentials from memory (Mimikatz-style) has vanished from the Top 10. The Digital Parasite doesn't need to break down the door when it can simply log in.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [TECHNIQUE]:** Credential theft at 23% is now double ransomware encryption at 13%. SantaStealer bypasses Chrome encryption by calling legitimate browser APIs. Identity theft has become the primary attack objective, not a preliminary step.

---

### Blinding the Watchman

Before the parasite can feed, it must neutralize the immune system.

The **Deadlock ransomware** abuses **SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe** — a legitimate Windows utility — to quietly disable Defender's real-time protection. No exploit. No admin credential. A trusted Microsoft binary, used as designed, pointed at the wrong target.

More aggressively, **RealBlindingEDR** tools surgically **remove kernel callbacks** — the hooks EDR agents use to monitor system activity. The EDR is still running. The dashboard shows green. But it's blind. Attackers operate in a ghost world, invisible to the tools built to stop them.

**Your EDR showing "no alerts" might be the most dangerous signal of all.**

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [TECHNIQUE]:** Defense impairment (T1562) is now a standard first step, with Deadlock using legitimate Windows utilities and RealBlindingEDR surgically removing kernel callbacks. A green security dashboard may indicate successful evasion, not the absence of threats.

---

### Below the OS: The Hardware Insider

North Korean operatives deployed **IP-KVM devices** (PiKVM) plugged directly into HDMI and USB ports of corporate laptops. This hardware-level access operates **completely below the operating system.** EDR can't see it. Antivirus can't scan it. The entire visibility stack — every agent, every sensor, every log — runs at the OS level and above.

The attacker is underneath all of it.

E83 documented CrowdStrike's finding about attackers operating from unmanaged VMs. Picus takes this deeper — the unmanaged asset isn't a forgotten VM. It's **hardware physically attached to managed endpoints that software cannot detect.**

> **INTEL [DPRK] [TECHNIQUE]:** DPRK operatives deployed IP-KVM hardware for BIOS-level laptop access, operating entirely below the OS where all software-based security controls are blind. This redefines "insider threat" from a compromised employee to a compromised machine.

---

### The Camouflage Artists

**Masquerading (T1036)** entered the Top 10 for the first time at 17%.

**Ferocious Kitten** used the Right-to-Left Override Unicode character to flip file extensions — a malicious `.exe` appears as a `.pdf`. You see a document. You double-click a document. The OS executes a binary.

**Mustang Panda** deployed malware with invalid or expired digital signatures that still fooled superficial trust checks. The visual indicators humans rely on — "Is it signed? Does it have a certificate?" — are now a vulnerability, not a control.

> **INTEL [GLOBAL] [TECHNIQUE]:** Masquerading (T1036) entered the Top 10 for the first time at 17%. Ferocious Kitten (RTLO extension reversal) and Mustang Panda (invalid signature abuse) demonstrate adversaries mastering the art of looking like the system they've infected.

## Convergence: Four Reports, One Picture

This is our fourth consecutive deep dive into a 2026 annual threat report. The convergence is now undeniable:

**Identity is the primary attack vector:**
- Unit 42: 90% of incidents involved identity compromise
- Cloudflare: 63% of human logins use compromised credentials
- CrowdStrike: 35% of cloud intrusions via valid accounts
- **Picus: Credential theft (23%) is now double ransomware encryption (13%)**

**Cloud is the battlefield AND the weapon:**
- Unit 42: 23% SaaS data exfiltration
- Cloudflare: Living off XaaS framework
- CrowdStrike: 266% increase in cloud intrusions
- **Picus: SesameOp C2 via OpenAI API, Storm-0501 via AWS Secrets Manager**

**Your security tools are being outmaneuvered:**
- CrowdStrike: Unmanaged VMs used to evade EDR
- **Picus: LummaC2 fools sandboxes with trigonometry, RealBlindingEDR removes kernel callbacks, Deadlock disables Defender with its own utilities**

**The adversary model has shifted permanently:**

- Break in, encrypt, ransom → **Inhabit, persist, extract**
- Deploy malware files → **Live off your own tools**
- Target the perimeter → **Target identity + cloud**
- Noisy, fast, destructive → **Silent, patient, parasitic**
- Success = disruption → **Success = dwell time**

## Recommended Actions

1. **Shift from hunting files to hunting behavior.** Static defenses are failing — 80% of top techniques are designed to evade them. Continuously simulate the Top 10 techniques (Process Injection, Sandbox Evasion, Defense Impairment) against your actual controls. If LummaC2's trigonometry check can fool your sandbox, you need to know before the adversary does.

2. **Hunt for silence.** A device that stops sending telemetry is not a connectivity issue — it's a potential defense impairment operation. Build detection for EDR agents that go quiet, logs that stop flowing, and dashboards that stay green for too long.

3. **Inspect trusted traffic.** SesameOp and Storm-0501 prove that trusted destinations are now C2 channels. Implement behavioral analysis on API traffic to OpenAI, AWS, Azure, and developer tools. Monitor for anomalous patterns, not just known-bad destinations.

4. **Eliminate browser password stores.** At 23% prevalence and rising, saved browser passwords are a liability. Enforce enterprise password managers. Deploy FIDO2/WebAuthn for privileged access. Disable "Save Password" via group policy.

5. **Secure the hardware layer.** DPRK IP-KVM operations prove software-only visibility is insufficient. Monitor USB/HDMI connections. Enforce BIOS/UEFI passwords and Secure Boot. For high-value remote workers, mandate physical workstation audits.

6. **Treat "nothing happened" as an alert.** If a file executes and shows no behavior, that's not clean — it may be evasion. Investigate processes that check system uptime, calculate mouse geometry, or sleep before executing. Move to hardware-assisted detonation environments that are harder to fingerprint.

7. **Assume the adversary is already inside.** Four reports, four vendors, one conclusion. Build your security program around detecting and containing an adversary who already has valid credentials, already lives in your cloud, and already looks like a legitimate user. Because increasingly, they do.
