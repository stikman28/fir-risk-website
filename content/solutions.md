## Data Platforms

Most companies have data everywhere—and too much of it is held hostage by third-party vendors. We implement Microsoft Fabric to fix that. We assess your data sources, identify what matters most to business performance, and build a company-owned data lake and warehouse. Data lakes, pipelines, dataflows, and integrated reporting—all under your control. The result: a data foundation that powers AI, reporting, and informed decisions across your organization.

## AI Solutions

Your own AI platform—built around your data, your workflows, and your specific business challenges. We build custom knowledge bases curated from your internal documents and trusted sources, intelligent agents tuned to your team's needs, and purpose-built tools that solve real problems. Whether it's an internal policy assistant, a compliance Q&A system, or investigation support tools, we design AI solutions your team can actually use—grounded in your data, not generic models.
