        <h3 id="data-platforms" class="h5">Data Platforms</h3>
        <p>Most companies have data everywhere — and too much of it is held hostage by third-party vendors. We implement Microsoft Fabric to fix that. We assess your data sources, identify what matters most to business performance, and build a company-owned data lake and warehouse. Data lakes, pipelines, dataflows, and integrated reporting — all under your control.</p>

We build custom knowledge bases curated from your internal documents and trusted sources, intelligent agents tuned to your team's needs, and purpose-built tools that solve real problems. Whether it's an internal policy assistant, a compliance Q&A system, or investigation support tools — grounded in your data, not generic models.</p>
