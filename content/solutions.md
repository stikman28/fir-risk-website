# AI & Data Solutions

Custom AI. Built for your reality.

Not every team needs a product—some need a solution built for their data, their workflows, their compliance requirements.

---

## What We Build

### AI Assistants & Agents

Domain-specific AI trained on your knowledge base, not generic models.

- Internal policy assistants
- Compliance Q&A systems
- Security operations copilots
- Investigation support agents

We design the prompts, curate the knowledge base, and deploy systems your team can actually use.

### Microsoft Fabric Data Platforms

Unified data lakes that turn scattered logs into AI-ready intelligence.

- Data pipeline architecture
- Cross-system integration
- Analytics and reporting layers
- Foundation for AI/ML workloads

Your data, structured and ready.

### RAG Implementations

Retrieval-augmented generation systems grounded in your proprietary data.

- Document ingestion pipelines
- Vector database setup
- Retrieval optimization
- Hallucination prevention

AI that cites your sources, not the internet's.

## The Approach

We don't just hand over a model.

1. **Understand** — Map your data landscape and workflows
2. **Architect** — Design the pipeline and knowledge structure
3. **Build** — Engineer the solution with verified sources
4. **Train** — Ensure your team can operate and extend it

Every solution is grounded in real frameworks—MITRE, NIST, ISO—not just generic LLM outputs.

## Advisory Support

Need strategy before implementation? We provide:

- **AI Readiness Assessments** — Is your data ready for AI? What's the gap?
- **Data Architecture Reviews** — Where are the integration points?
- **Use Case Prioritization** — Which AI applications deliver ROI fastest?
