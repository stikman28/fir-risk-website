## About / Why I Built This

I've spent my career on both sides of the equation—building technology systems, auditing them, securing them, and managing the risks that come with all of it. Accounting taught me to follow the numbers. Audit taught me to question everything. Cybersecurity and fraud taught me what's really at stake.

When AI became truly capable, I saw an opportunity: what if we could combine deep domain expertise with AI that's actually grounded in trusted sources? Not generic chatbots that hallucinate—but intelligent tools built on real frameworks, real research, and real experience.

That's why I started FIR Risk Advisory. We build AI solutions, data platforms, and risk intelligence tools for organizations that need more than guesswork. Whether it's our own FIR Risk Platform, a custom AI solution, or a Microsoft Fabric implementation—everything we build is grounded in the same principle: trusted sources and real expertise.

If you're looking for a partner who's done the work, reach out.
